              Why did we upgrade?
            </h2>
            <p>
              There have been significant updates to the new version of EMS,
              including: enhanced system security, increased performance,
              increased usability, and newly added features. There is also a new
              back-end component, Platform Services, that allows for a wider
              range of system customizations.

              What's the difference between this version and the old version?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The biggest change you'll notice in EMS version 44.1 is the new
              interface of the <code>EMS Web App</code>, the replacement product
              for VirtualEMS. Please see the

            <h2>What is the EMS Desktop Client?</h2>
            <p>
              The <code>EMS Desktop Client</code> is software that is installed
              directly on your desktop workstation that allows access to all
              functions of EMS. Plesae note some functions of the EMS Desktop
              Client require specific permissions to access, that an EMS
              administrator can provision with applicable business case. Please
              see <a href="#contacts">contacts</a> on the bottom of this page
              for information on who you can send EMS access requests.
            </p>
            <h2>How do I download/install the EMS Desktop Client?</h2>
            <p>
              EMS version 44.1 has introduced a new feature called
              <code>EMS Desktop Client Web Deploy</code> that allows you to
              download the EMS Desktop Client over the Stern intranet. This new
              feature also ensures you download the most up-to-date version of
              the Desktop Client. Please see below for the URL to download the
